                    Code whisperer by day, React wrangler by night. I build fast, functional, and
                    user-focused web apps using ReactJS, JavaScript (ES6+), Tailwind CSS, and a bit
                    of CSS wizardry üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Whether it‚Äôs real-time delivery tracking, or lightning-fast
                    UIs, I love crafting slick SPAs that just work ‚Äî clean code, smooth UX, and a
                    dash of JavaScript magic ‚ú®.

                    I‚Äôm currently diving deeper into the React rabbit hole ‚Äî taming re-renders with
                    useCallback, mastering memo, and bending React Router to my will. When I‚Äôm not
                    optimizing components, you‚Äôll probably find me playing with UI transitions or
                    shaving milliseconds off load times.

                    Previously at Deloitte, I built features used by thousands, mentored teammates,
                    and made frontend magic happen. Now, I‚Äôm at CMU ‚Äî and always looking for the
                    next cool thing to build.
